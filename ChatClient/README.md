#Project Specific Topics

    This project includes methods that update the ChatClient GUI. Some of these methods include, grabbing and sending the message from the client over to the server, displaying messages that the client sent in the client chat-log, displaying whether they have connected or disconnected from the server. The client can also send command messages that can update the current clients name and can display a list the ID's of the connected clients
