#Assignment Specific Topics

    This project deals with all of the networking and communication code. It uses Microsoft's TcpClient class to establish connections, send and receive stream data from other clients. It creates a TCP client with the given host name of the server, ex: localhost and the server port, ex: 11000. Some functionality of this project includes being able to wait for messages, checking the messages for the correct ending protocol to send the message back off to all other connected clients, being able to shut down the server and disconnect every client.
